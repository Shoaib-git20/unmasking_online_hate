The Round4_test file has code that takes input from only round 4 test data, as labeled in the given datasheet.

The complete_hate file has code that takes input data from all hate-labeled tweets, given as per the datasheet.

For running on a local machine, download the folder and change the data path line in the code file as per your requirements.

For running on Google Colab, directly load the datasheet in the Colab runtime and compile the code file.
